### MassTransit Saga State Machine using RabbitMQ with Razor Pages/ViewsðŸ“¨ (Made as simple as possible)
This Project was made in Visual Studio 2022!
- Tutorials on YouTube are too long or you don't understand what's going on?ðŸ˜…
- Well, I did the research and figured it out. I made it as simple as it gets for the basic understandingðŸ˜ƒ
- Also, instead of using Swagger I made a simple UI with Razor Pages/Views using a CRUD. (Finally, someone that did itðŸ«¢)
- Someone has to do it for the IT Noobies like myselfðŸ˜Ž
